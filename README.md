# Mel2Word: Melody to Text Representation

This repository implements Mel2Word, a method for converting melodic sequences into text-based representations for symbolic music analysis. Developed by Saebyul Park, Eunjin Choi, Jeounghoon Kim, and Juhan Nam, Mel2Word offers a unique tokenization approach, capturing the essence of musical phrases through natural language processing.

## Mel2Word Features

### Mel2Word Representation

Convert your MIDI melodies into Mel2Word representations.

### Mel2Word Dictionaries

Tokenization requires a dictionary. You can either use pre-generated dictionaries or create your own based on your dataset. 

### Tokenization

Tokenize your melody with the Pre-train or generated dictionary.


## Environmental Setup

To run the Mel2Word implementation, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- **PrettyMIDI:** A Python library for handling MIDI files. Install it using `pip install pretty_midi`.
- **Google Drive Mounting:** If you're using Google Colab, mount your Google Drive to access files seamlessly. Follow the steps provided in the Colab notebook.
