# Mel2Word: Melody to Text Representation

This repository implements the Mel2Word method, designed to convert melodic sequences into text-based representations for symbolic music analysis through natural language processing. Mel2Word introduces an innovative approach to music analysis by transforming melodic sequences into meaningful linguistic-like units, providing a unique tokenization that captures the essence of musical phrases.

For detailed information, please refer to the following journal article:

"Mel2Word: A Text-based Melody Representation for Symbolic Music Analysis" by Saebyul Park, Eunjin Choi, Jeounghoon Kim, and Juhan Nam, accepted for publication in Music and Science, 2023.

## Environment

To get started, you can use this Colab notebook to explore Mel2Word representation and the associated methods.

### Mel2Word representation

First, convert your MIDI melodies into Mel2Word representation using the provided code and examples:

```python
# Codes for Mel2Word
# ...

# Example:
midi_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Mel2Word/midi_test.midi'
M2W_pitch = get_M2W_from_midipath(midi_path, feature_option=1)
M2W_rhythm = get_M2W_from_midipath(midi_path, feature_option=2)
M2W_all = get_M2W_from_midipath(midi_path, feature_option=3)
print(M2W_pitch)
print(M2W_rhythm)
print(M2W_all)
```

### Mel2Word Dictionaries

Tokenization requires a dictionary. You can either use pre-generated dictionaries or create your own. Examples for both scenarios are provided:

#### Pre-generated Dictionaries

Load a pre-generated dictionary:

```python
# Codes for Pre-Generated Dictionaries
# ...

# Example:
dic_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Mel2Word/Dictionary/Dictionary_pitch.pkl'
dictionary = load_dictionary(dic_path)
```

#### Generate New Dictionary

Generate a new dictionary using your own dataset:

```python
# Codes for generating new dictionary
# ...

# Example:
mypath = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Mel2Word/data_example'
data = get_M2Wdataset(mypath)
my_dic = BPE(data, feat=1, dic_size=10000, min_num=10, max_length=11)
print(my_dic)
```

### Tokenization

Now that you have a dictionary, you can tokenize your melody:

```python
# Code for Tokenization
M2Wtoken = get_M2W_tokens(M2W_pitch, my_dic, dic_size=100, feat=1)
```

For more details, refer to the Colab notebook.
